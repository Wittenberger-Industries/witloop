# Copilot CLI: tool & capability mapping for wi

wi's skills are written with Claude Code names. On Copilot CLI, use these equivalents.

## ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
Copilot has no plugin-root variable. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` means the **wi plugin root**: the directory
holding `skills/`, `agents/`, and `.claude-plugin/`. Where that root lives depends on how wi was installed:

- **Preferred (plugin install):** `copilot plugin install Wittenberger-Industries/wi-plugin` (Copilot CLI
  reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and defaults to `skills/` + `agents/`). The whole repo lands under
  `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/…`; that installed directory is the wi root. Update with
  `copilot plugin update wi`.
- **Fallback (clone):** `git clone` + `/skills add <repo>/skills` (older CLI versions). The clone is the
  wi root.

Either way, install wi **whole** and resolve every `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path against that root. This is
why per-skill `gh skill install` is discouraged: cross-skill refs such as `ship` reading
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/scan/scripts/check_mermaid.py`, and the plugin-version read from
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, need the shared root.

## Tools
| wi/skill says | Copilot equivalent |
|---|---|
| Read | `view` |
| Write | `create` |
| Edit | `edit` / `apply_patch` |
| Bash | `bash` |
| Grep / Glob | `grep` / `glob` |
| dispatch a subagent / task-runner | `task` tool (custom agent) |
| parallel waves | `/fleet` (monitor with `/tasks`) |
| WebFetch | `web_fetch` |
| WebSearch | no equivalent; use `web_fetch` with a search URL |
| invoke a wi skill | skills load natively: `/wi <skill>` (plugin), `/wi-scan`/`/wi-dev`/`/wi-rpa` (flat aliases), or auto-trigger by description |

## /goal keep-alive
Copilot has no predicate `/goal`. Use **Autopilot**: relaunch with the completion condition in the prompt:
`copilot --autopilot --max-autopilot-continues <N> --no-ask-user --allow-all -p "<prompt incl. done-condition>"`.
Completion is model-judged and continuation-capped, not a hard predicate. `--no-ask-user --allow-all` runs
fully unattended (prompts suppressed, all tools/paths granted); drop `--allow-all` to keep risky-action
confirmations.

## Command namespace
`/wi:dev` etc. do not exist. Plugin-installed skills are auto-prefixed with the plugin name: wi's entry
points invoke as `/wi scan`, `/wi dev`, `/wi rpa` (the prefix is Copilot's, not configurable; a separator
inside a skill `name` makes it silently fail to load). For a one-token form, scan's bootstrap offers to
copy the flat aliases from `references/skill-aliases/` into `~/.agents/skills/`, giving `/wi-scan`,
`/wi-dev`, `/wi-rpa` (flat skills carry no prefix). The clone + `/skills add` fallback registers skills
flat too. The phase skills (brainstorm, research, plan, build, ship) are `user-invocable: false`: hidden
from the `/` picker, invoked by the orchestrating skill or by natural language; every skill still
auto-triggers from its `description`.

## Usage & AI credits (the `tokens.md` ledger on Copilot)
Copilot bills in **GitHub AI Credits** (since 2026-06-01; 1 credit = $0.01, computed from token
consumption at per-model rates, the successor to premium requests). What wi can and cannot record:

- **Per-subagent rows: `unavailable`.** `task`-tool dispatches produce no per-task usage figure and no
  per-agent transcript; the finest native unit is the session (total credits + a per-model token
  breakdown). Ledger rows on Copilot record
  `unavailable (Copilot exposes no per-task usage)` as their Basis; Duration cells still work (they
  come from the orchestrator's own OS-clock stamps).
- **Run level: record only what is actually on screen.** Interactive: the user's `/usage` output
  (AI credits used, per-model tokens, session duration) may be copied verbatim into the ledger's
  `## Orchestrator` section as `AI credits (from /usage): <figure>`. Programmatic/Autopilot runs print
  usage statistics with the response unless `-s/--silent`; same rule. No figure in the conversation →
  `Orchestrator: unavailable for this run`; never estimate credits.
- **`token_report.py`'s transcript parse and per-subagent split are Claude Code-only** (they read
  `~/.claude/projects/**` and its `subagents/` sidecars). The duration totals and `progress.md`
  wall-clock still finalize normally on Copilot: timing comes from wi's own stamps, not the platform.
- **Post-hoc reconciliation** (outside the run): `GET /users/{username}/settings/billing/ai_credit/usage`
  (or the `/organizations/{org}/…` variant) reports credits per day/model/user with ~30-minute lag, and
  the billing CSV itemizes per interaction, useful to attribute a run's real cost after the fact, but
  wi never writes these delayed figures into a shipping dossier as if they were measured in-run.
