# Tiered model routing: model assignments for wit's dispatched agents

wit dispatches three kinds of sub-agents (**wit-researcher**, **wit-task-runner**, **wit-code-checker**) plus
the **orchestrator**, which is just the session itself (the agent reading this file, planning and routing
the run). Tiered model routing lets a project tune what each of the three sub-agents runs on, and adds an
**independent cross-provider diff review**, ideally a *different provider/architecture* (different training,
different blind spots), as a layer on top of wit-code-checker's result-mode verification. Scope: **wit-dispatched agents only**
(wit-researcher, wit-task-runner, wit-code-checker, RPA build delegations); wit never re-models other plugins'
or the user's own agents.

**The orchestrator model is informational.** A plugin cannot set the session model; the user picks it
with `/model`. wit records the intended tier and, at run start, **warns once** if the session model is
below it (e.g. config says `fable`, session runs `haiku`); it never blocks. The reverse is **not** a
mismatch and gets no warning: a session running *above* the configured tier (say a `fable` session over
the simple preset) still dispatches every role at its **configured** tier: premium tiers are priced
accordingly, so wit never auto-escalates a dispatch above config. A tier above `opus` enters a run only
when the user put it there: choosing **smart** interactively, or writing it into custom rows / per-agent
overrides.

## The config file: `.wit/models.md`

Project-level, persisted, resolved **once per run** at the entry skills (the resolve-once rule below);
dispatches read the resolved block in `progress.md`, not this file. Template (fill from a preset, then let
the user override any cell):

# Model assignments

## Roles
| Role | Model | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| orchestrator | <fable\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku> | informational: session model, set via /model; wit warns on mismatch |
| wit-code-checker | <fable\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku\|inherit> | the checker's Claude dispatch tier, never below orchestrator's tier |
| wit-researcher | <fable\|opus\|sonnet\|haiku\|inherit> | one Claude tier below orchestrator |
| wit-task-runner | <opus\|sonnet\|haiku\|inherit> | default for every wit-task-runner dispatch |

## Cross-provider config
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| provider | <openai \| anthropic \| none> |
| base_url | <https://api.openai.com/v1> |
| model | <gpt-5> |
| api_key_env | <OPENAI_API_KEY> |
| check_points | <at-finish \| per-wave> |

## Per-agent overrides
| Agent | Model |
|-------|-------|
| <wit-researcher \| wit-task-runner \| wit-code-checker \| rpa-build> | <tier> |

## Mixture of Agents
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| points | none |
| proposers | opus, sonnet, sonnet |
| layers | 1 |
| aggregator | opus |
```

Claude tiers are the Agent-dispatch tokens `fable | opus | sonnet | haiku`, plus `inherit` (= the session
model). The cross-provider model is the *provider's* model id, independent of the Claude tier tokens.

## Platform model resolution (non-Claude hosts)

The Roles-table tokens (`fable | opus | sonnet | haiku`) are the **canonical routing tiers**, defined on
Claude. On a **non-Claude host** every dispatch runs that host's own models, so the resolve-once step maps
each tier to a concrete host model through an optional `## Platform model map`:

```markdown
## Platform model map
| Tier | grok |
|------|------|
| fable | grok-4.5 |
| opus | grok-4.5 |
| sonnet | grok-composer-2.5-fast |
| haiku | grok-composer-2.5-fast |
```

- Columns are host names (`grok`); rows map a canonical tier to that host's model id (resolved from
  `grok models` at config time: `grok-4.5` is the strong/default model, `grok-composer-2.5-fast` the
  cheap/fast one). An unmapped tier, or `inherit`, passes through unchanged.
- **Host detection:** the host is `grok` when the run follows `references/grok-tools.md` (wit was invoked
  under the `grok` CLI); otherwise the host is `claude` and the tier tokens are used as-is. Codex and
  Copilot are `claude`-tier hosts here unless they later gain their own map column.
- The `## Model routing (resolved)` block records the concrete per-role model for the running host: a
  Grok model id on a Grok host, the Claude tier token on Claude. `orchestrator` stays informational (the
  session model, set by the host's own model selector).
- **Cross-provider diversity on a Grok host:** point the cross-provider layer at `openai` or `anthropic`,
  not `xai` (a Grok host reviewing with a Grok model is same-family, which defeats the diversity purpose).
  The `provider: xai` entry is for the *other* hosts.
- The map is optional: absent it, non-Claude hosts run every dispatch at the session model (`inherit`
  behavior), the same as today.

The cross-provider `provider` accepts `openai | anthropic | xai | none`. `xai` uses xAI's
OpenAI-compatible endpoint: set `model` (e.g. `grok-4.5`) and `api_key_env` (`XAI_API_KEY`); `base_url`
defaults to `https://api.x.ai/v1` when unset.

## Presets

| Role | **smart** | **simple** |
|------|-----------|------------|
| orchestrator | fable | opus |
| wit-code-checker | fable | opus |
| wit-researcher | opus | sonnet |
| wit-task-runner | opus | sonnet |
| cross-provider | gpt-5 (openai) | none |
| MoA | none | none |

Each role's default follows a rule, not an arbitrary pick:

- **`wit-code-checker`** dispatches at this same-family Claude tier and is **never weaker than the orchestrator**:
  smart's orchestrator is already top-tier (`fable`), so checker matches it there; simple's orchestrator
  is `opus`, so checker matches that (not a downgrade to `sonnet`/`haiku`). Verification is the one place
  not to cut corners. The floor is the **configured** orchestrator tier, never the live session model:
  a top-tier session over the simple preset still dispatches the checker at `opus`, by design (pricing;
  see the no-auto-escalation rule above).
- **`wit-researcher`** is one Claude tier below the orchestrator (`fable→opus→sonnet→haiku`, floor at
  `haiku`): cheaper exploratory work doesn't need the top tier.
- **`wit-task-runner`** scales with the preset directly (smart → `opus`, simple → `sonnet`): it's the
  highest-volume dispatch (one per plan task), so its cost profile should track the preset's overall
  intent.

**smart** = top-tier checker + strong researcher/task-runner + cross-architecture check, the only preset
that reaches **above `opus`**, and it is never a default: it must be chosen interactively (or written by
hand). **simple** = the `opus`/`sonnet` lean pass-through, no cross-provider check, the `--auto` default;
its ceiling is `opus` **by design** (pricing: top tiers are never a default anywhere in wit). Presets only
*pre-fill* the table: every cell stays individually overridable (a hand-written override may name any
tier, including `fable`).

## First-run setup (dev / rpa entry points)

When `.wit/models.md` is **absent** at a wit entry skill (dev:1, rpa:2): **interactive** → ask once
(*"Model routing: smart, simple, or custom?"*), pre-fill from the chosen preset (`wit-researcher`'s literal
is computed once as one tier below the chosen orchestrator tier), confirm the per-role rows (and any
per-agent override), write the file **and commit it** (`chore(wit): models config`, the project-level rule
in `wit-directory.md`: committed where written, so post-worktree phases read the same tracked copy).
**`--auto`** → write + commit the **simple** preset and log it as an
assumption. Either way the file persists and is **never re-asked** (edit `.wit/models.md` to change it). When
the file exists, skip setup entirely, just apply it, warning once if the session model is below the
configured orchestrator tier (the orchestrator-model rule above). Setup ends by resolving the routing once
and recording it as the `## Model routing (resolved)` block when the feature's `progress.md` is seeded
(dev:2 / rpa's run seed), the resolve-once rule below.

## Dispatch rule (build, research, ship, rpa): resolve once, dispatch many

**Resolve at entry.** At dev:1 / rpa:2, or at the first dispatch that finds no block
(a hand-edited or incomplete `progress.md`), resolve every dispatch kind **once**: per-agent override → the
agent's own role → `inherit` (`wit-code-checker` reads the `wit-code-checker` role, `wit-researcher`
reads `wit-researcher`, `wit-task-runner` reads `wit-task-runner`; RPA build delegations resolve
`rpa-build` override → `wit-task-runner` role → `inherit`: `rpa-build` is a **role label** for those
delegations, not a registered agent; there is no `agents/rpa-build.md`). Record the result as the
`## Model routing (resolved)` block in the feature's `progress.md` (template: wit-directory.md),
stamped, with the cross-provider and MoA rows carried compactly. The block caches the **configured**
tiers, never the live session model (the no-auto-escalation rule above); resolving once changes
cost, never behavior: same `.wit/models.md`, same assignments.

**Dispatch reads the block.** At every wit Agent dispatch, read the tier from the resolved block and
pass it as the dispatch's model parameter; do **not** re-open this reference or `.wit/models.md`.
Re-resolve (rewrite the block) only when the block is **absent** or `.wit/models.md` **changed after
the block's stamp** (its last commit (`git log -1 --format=%cI -- .wit/models.md`) or mtime, newer
than the stamp). No `.wit/models.md` at all → everything inherits; record
`preset: none - all inherit` so later dispatches don't re-check. **Exception (MoA dispatches):** a
dispatch carrying an `MoA role:` marker resolves from the block's MoA row: each proposer at its
listed `proposers` tier, the aggregator at the `aggregator` tier
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/moa.md`). **Fallback (unchanged):** a configured model that
errors as unavailable at dispatch time → re-dispatch with `inherit` and note it in `progress.md`:
the block itself stands; the config didn't change. Never stall a run on a model assignment.

## wit-code-checker's two modes

`wit-code-checker` (`agents/wit-code-checker.md`) always runs **twice per feature** (plan mode before the
design gate, result mode before shipping), and both are Agent-tool dispatches at the `wit-code-checker`
role's Claude tier:

- **PLAN mode** (pre-gate, before a diff exists; verifies spec/task coverage). There's no diff yet to
  hand a cross-provider script, so this mode is same-family only.
- **RESULT mode** (at ship): confirms every acceptance criterion + locked decision is delivered and
  **wired**, refreshing `verification.md`. When a cross-provider is configured, the independent diff review
  described next runs **beside** this dispatch (never instead of it), and when `check_points: per-wave`,
  that diff-review layer additionally runs at each build wave-end gate over the wave's diff (the checker
  itself still runs twice per feature).

### The cross-provider diff review (a layer beside wit-code-checker's result mode)

Not a per-tool-call interceptor (running every reviewer role cross-provider was rejected as cost-prohibitive; only this independent cross-provider layer at ship survived): it's an
**independent third-party line-level review of the finished diff**, run by ship:2 conceptually beside its
self-review; and, when `check_points: per-wave`, additionally at each build wave-end gate over that
wave's diff. The point is **model diversity**: the checker itself is Claude-family (subagents can only run
Claude models); this script is how another model family gets a look at the diff. It is a different check,
not a substitute: the script only receives the diff + spec text (no Read/Grep/Bash against the repo), so
it cannot verify things are actually wired, and it does not write `verification.md`. Mechanics:

1. Produce the diff (`git diff <base>...HEAD` for at-finish; the wave's commits for per-wave) to a temp
   file, plus context: `spec.md` (or the SDD's acceptance-criteria section) and the relevant
   constitution rules.
2. Run `python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ship/scripts/cross_review.py --config .wit/models.md
   --diff <patch> --context <spec> --out .wit/features/<slug>/cross-review.md` (python fallback:
   `references/workflow.md` "Script invocation").
3. Exit `0` = `## REVIEW PASSED`; `1` = `## ISSUES FOUND`; treat findings like any checker finding:
   BLOCKER → fix (loop back to build), WARNING/INFO → address or record. Both layers share the **max 2
   review→fix rounds** budget; whatever remains after round 2 is surfaced, with
   severity, in `PR.md`'s Verification section. `3` = no API key in `api_key_env` and `2` = config or API
   error govern only whether **this layer** runs: log `cross-provider layer skipped (<reason>)` and
   continue; wit-code-checker's result-mode dispatch is unconditional and runs regardless. The
   cross-provider script works alone: the orchestrator hands it the diff and takes back findings; it does
   not steer the review.
4. `cross-review.md` is **ephemeral** like `verification.md`: ship:5 distills the verdict into `PR.md`,
   then the dossier tidy (ship:6) prunes both.

The cross-provider review is a standalone layer: it needs only the `## Cross-provider config` section and
works even when every role is `inherit` (no tier routing in use). The escalation contract in
`agents/wit-task-runner.md` (architectural decisions stop and ask the orchestrator) is likewise
independent of this file.

`Cross-provider config` `provider: none` (simple preset) → skip the script entirely; RESULT mode still
dispatches `wit-code-checker` at its Roles-table tier, same as PLAN mode: the cross-provider path is a
layer on top of checker, never a replacement.

### Mixture of Agents (optional)

An optional proposer/aggregator layer at wit's two judgment points, the research approach decision and the
checker's result-mode review at ship: N proposer agents answer the same question independently (optionally
refining in a second round), and one aggregator synthesizes the single answer. **Off by default**: both
presets write `points: none`, and a config without the `## Mixture of Agents` section is treated as
`points: none`; enable it by hand-editing `.wit/models.md`. The full contract (dispatch markers,
who-writes-what, layer semantics, cost) is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/moa.md`; it composes with
the tier routing above, but neither requires the other.
