  Alias of wi's dev skill for flat-skill installs (Copilot CLI /wi-dev, Codex CLI $wi-dev) — forwards to
  the wi plugin's dev entry point: brainstorm a feature, design it, confirm at the design gate, then
  build and ship hands-off to an open PR. Supports "--auto" to auto-approve the gate.

# /wi-dev — alias of wi's `dev` skill

A forwarding alias, installed flat (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/`) so the command reads `/wi-dev` on Copilot
CLI and `$wi-dev` on Codex CLI without the plugin-namespace prefix. The real skill ships inside the wi
plugin — this file contains no loop logic of its own.

1. Locate the **wi plugin root** — the installed plugin directory (or clone) holding `skills/`,
   `agents/`, and `.claude-plugin/` (Copilot: under `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/…`).
2. Read `AGENTS.md` at that root (the cross-platform bootstrap), then follow `skills/dev/SKILL.md` with
   the user's arguments as the feature idea, passing `--auto` through if given.

If no wi plugin root exists, say so and point the user at
`https://github.com/Wittenberger-Industries/wi-plugin` — do not improvise the loop from this alias.
