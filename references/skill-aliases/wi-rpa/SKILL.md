  Alias of wi's rpa skill for flat-skill installs (Copilot CLI /wi-rpa, Codex CLI $wi-rpa) — forwards to
  the wi plugin's rpa entry point: turn a UiPath PDD into a built REFramework or Maestro solution through
  the wi loop to a PR. Supports "--auto" for a hands-off run.

# /wi-rpa — alias of wi's `rpa` skill

A forwarding alias, installed flat (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/`) so the command reads `/wi-rpa` on Copilot
CLI and `$wi-rpa` on Codex CLI without the plugin-namespace prefix. The real skill ships inside the wi
plugin — this file contains no RPA logic of its own.

1. Locate the **wi plugin root** — the installed plugin directory (or clone) holding `skills/`,
   `agents/`, and `.claude-plugin/` (Copilot: under `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/…`).
2. Read `AGENTS.md` at that root (the cross-platform bootstrap), then follow `skills/rpa/SKILL.md` with
   the user's arguments (the PDD path or reference), passing `--auto` through if given.

If no wi plugin root exists, say so and point the user at
`https://github.com/Wittenberger-Industries/wi-plugin` — do not improvise the build from this alias.
