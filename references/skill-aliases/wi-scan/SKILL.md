  Alias of wi's scan skill for flat-skill installs (Copilot CLI /wi-scan, Codex CLI $wi-scan) — forwards
  to the wi plugin's scan entry point: document a project folder and bootstrap wi in it. Supports
  "--refresh" to drift-check an existing scan and consolidate learnings.

# /wi-scan — alias of wi's `scan` skill

A forwarding alias, installed flat (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/`) so the command reads `/wi-scan` on Copilot
CLI and `$wi-scan` on Codex CLI without the plugin-namespace prefix. The real skill ships inside the wi
plugin — this file contains no scan logic of its own.

1. Locate the **wi plugin root** — the installed plugin directory (or clone) holding `skills/`,
   `agents/`, and `.claude-plugin/` (Copilot: under `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/…`).
2. Read `AGENTS.md` at that root (the cross-platform bootstrap), then follow `skills/scan/SKILL.md` with
   the user's arguments, passing `--refresh` through if given.

If no wi plugin root exists, say so and point the user at
`https://github.com/Wittenberger-Industries/wi-plugin` — do not improvise the scan from this alias.
