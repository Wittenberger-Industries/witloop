# The `.wi/` directory: WI's on-repo state

All WI state lives in a single `.wi/` folder at the repo root. It is an
[OKF](/docs/specs/2026-06-14-okf-knowledge-format.md) knowledge bundle: plain Markdown with YAML
frontmatter, meant to be **committed** so the team (and your future self) can see how a feature was
reasoned about. Keep every file small and current; these are working artifacts, not essays.

```

## Conventions

- **Slugs** are short, kebab-case, derived from the feature, **prefixed with a global 4-digit ordinal
  assigned at creation**: "Add Stripe webhooks" -> `0001-stripe-webhooks`. The prefix mirrors `ADR-NNNN`
  (global across `.wi/features/`, monotonic, **never renumbered**) so `.wi/features/` lists in implementation
  order; next number = highest existing `.wi/features/` ordinal + 1 (else `0001`); the scan reads only
  `NNNN-` prefixes, so non-numeric folder names contribute nothing to the max. A resumed feature keeps its
  number; a roadmap row's name is numbered when its folder is first created. Creation-time edge cases (resume,
  in-flight overlap, done-collision, roadmap rows):
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/feature-folder-cases.md`.
- **Commit `.wi/`.** It is documentation. Feature-folder lifecycle: untracked in the main checkout through
  brainstorm/research/plan; research commits it on main at the design gate (`docs(<slug>): feature
  dossier (design gate)`), so the gate decides against committed artifacts and the build worktree
  (branched from main) starts with them; during build the **branch copy is canonical**, and main's copy
  catches up when the branch merges. **Project-level files are committed where they're written, by the
  phase that writes them**: scan its docs (+ the greenfield `.gitignore`), brainstorm glossary updates,
  research the ADR + its index row, dev/rpa `models.md` / `roadmap.md`, ship the docs-sync
  (`chore(wi): …` / `docs(wi): …` subjects); **only the feature folder defers**, to research's design-gate
  commit. That is what puts ADRs and the dossier on the branch (committed on main before build branches
  from HEAD) and lets every post-worktree phase read the same tracked
  copies. A team that doesn't want wi committing to main overrides this in the constitution. Gitignore
  `research/` only if it gets large or holds scraped material; leave a one-line summary in the ADR/spec
  instead.
- **Keep files lean.** Past ~150 lines a file is doing too much; split or summarize. Cheap handoff is the
  whole point.
- **One writer per phase.** A phase owns its outputs; later phases read but don't silently rewrite them.
- **No strays.** Everything feature-specific lives under `features/<slug>/`, never loose in `.wi/`. If a phase
  needs a scratch file, it goes in the slug folder (ship sweeps and deletes strays at the dossier tidy).
- **`research/`, `verification.md`, `cross-review.md`, and `.logs/` are ephemeral.** Working notes exist to produce
  the ADR and spec; the checker's `verification.md` feeds the design gate (plan mode) and the ship review
  (result mode); `cross-review.md` is the cross-provider diff review's output (ship, only when configured).
  Their verdicts + any waived findings fold into `PR.md` (ship:5), then the dossier tidy (ship:6) prunes all
  four before the PR (unless the constitution says keep them). This bullet is ship's prune list for the
  dev flow: the tidy prunes exactly what it names. `.logs/` holds redirected command output (workflow.md's
  output house rule); its own `.gitignore` (containing `*`) keeps it out of `git status` and every dossier
  commit, so it is never tracked; the tidy plain-deletes the directory. After `done`, a feature folder
  holds exactly the seven-file dossier: progress, brief, spec, tasks, pitfalls, tokens, PR.
- **Project-level memory persists & compounds.** `constitution.md`, `repo-map.md`, `overview.md`,
  `architecture.md`, `glossary.md`, `adr/`, `roadmap.md`, `models.md`, `learnings.md`, and `learnings/` belong to the
  project, never pruned. Each feature reads them at the start and ship writes back into them, so the project
  gets smarter per feature.
- **Learnings recall is via the index.** Phases read `.wi/learnings.md` (one line + hook per feature) and
  open a `learnings/<slug>.md` detail file only when its hook is relevant to the current feature; never
  bulk-read the directory. Timing note: ship commits a feature's learnings (+ its index line) on the
  **feature branch**, so main's `learnings.md` lacks in-flight features' lines until their PRs merge;
  `scan --refresh` on main reads that as normal lag, not drift.

## OKF frontmatter & conventions

Every `.wi/` file is an [OKF](/docs/specs/2026-06-14-okf-knowledge-format.md) concept: it opens with a
YAML frontmatter block whose only required key is `type`. The full profile lives in that spec; the short
version:

- **Frontmatter.** `type` (required) + `title`, `description`, `timestamp` (ISO 8601), optional `tags`,
  plus wi extensions `feature` / `status` / `resource` where they apply. Keep the body's `# Title` H1 and
  `##` sections as they are.
- **`type` per file:** `constitution.md` → `Constitution`, `repo-map.md` → `Repo Map`, `overview.md` →
  `Overview`, `architecture.md` → `Architecture`, `glossary.md` → `Glossary`, `adr/ADR-*.md` → `ADR`,
  `learnings.md` → `Learnings Index`, `learnings/<slug>.md` → `Learning`, `roadmap.md` → `Roadmap`,
  `models.md` → `Model Routing Config`; per
  feature: `progress.md` → `Feature Progress`, `brief.md` → `Brief`, `spec.md` → `Spec`, `tasks.md` →
  `Task List`, `pitfalls.md` → `Pitfalls`, `verification.md` → `Verification`, `tokens.md` →
  `Token Ledger`, `PR.md` → `PR Description`, `research/*.md` → `Research Note`,
  `research/runtime-state-inventory.md` → `Runtime State Inventory`.
- **Index files.** OKF-reserved `index.md` / `log.md` files carry **no frontmatter**: `adr/index.md` is
  one (the ADR template's bare index is correct; `validate.py` exempts the reserved names), except the
  optional root `.wi/index.md`, which may declare `okf_version: "0.1"`. `learnings.md` is *not* a reserved
  index (it's a named file) and **is** typed (`Learnings Index`). Entries in both reuse each concept's
  `description`.
- **Log.** `progress.md`'s `## Log` lines open with a **full ISO-8601 timestamp** (date + time +
  offset, e.g. `2026-07-05T14:19:47+02:00`) and a leading bold keyword (`**Created**`,
  `**Update**`, `**Decision**`); it stays append-order as a resumable run timeline. Stamps come
  from the **OS clock** (`date -Iseconds`, or
  `python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ship/scripts/now.py` where that shell syntax is
  unavailable), never a model estimate; ship's `token_report.py` derives the run's autonomous
  wall-clock from exactly these stamps (spans + exclusions: the `tokens.md` section below), so a
  date-only or invented stamp makes timing `unavailable`.
- **Citations.** External sources go under a numbered `## Citations` heading at the foot of the doc.
- **Links.** Prefer bundle-relative `/features/<slug>/spec.md`; a broken link (not-yet-written knowledge) is
  normal, never an error.

## `progress.md` template

Seed it when the feature is created (by `dev`):

```markdown
---
type: Feature Progress
title: <one-line feature title>
description: <what this feature delivers, one line>
feature: <slug>
status: brainstorm   # brainstorm | research | plan | design-gate | build | ship | done
timestamp: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# Feature: <one-line feature title>

- **Slug:** <slug>
- **Created:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Phase:** brainstorm        <!-- brainstorm | research | plan | design-gate | build | ship | done -->
- **Gate mode:** interactive   <!-- interactive | auto-approve (set by /wi:dev --auto) -->
- **Flow:** dev                <!-- dev | rpa; ship keys its dossier manifest + sweep whitelist on it; a missing line means dev -->
- **Worktree:** <path or "-">
- **Branch:** <branch or "-">

## Model routing (resolved)
<!-- written when progress.md is seeded (dev:1-2 / rpa:2) from .wi/models.md; dispatches
     read THIS block, not models.md. Rewrite only when absent or .wi/models.md changed after the
     stamp (models.md's resolve-once rule). Keep the stamp mid-line: Log-span parsing keys on
     stamps that OPEN a line. -->
- resolved <ISO-8601 stamp> from .wi/models.md (preset: <smart | simple | custom | none - all inherit>)
- orchestrator=<tier> (informational) · checker=<tier> · researcher=<tier> · task-runner=<tier> · rpa-build=<tier>
- cross-provider=<none | provider model (at-finish | per-wave)> · MoA=<none | points=<…>; proposers=<…>; layers=<n>; aggregator=<tier>>

## Skill paths (resolved)
<!-- LAZY: written the first time the run dispatches a capability-tagged task (e.g. [frontend]); a run
     with no such task omits this whole block. Maps each mapped skill (capability->skill is
     integrations.md) to the absolute path of its SKILL.md, or "absent" when not installed. Same
     staleness rule as the routing block; pinned runners Read this path (they have no Skill tool). -->
- frontend-design: <abs path to SKILL.md | absent>

## Log
- <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±hh:mm> **Created** feature, phase = brainstorm

## Tasks (mirrored from tasks.md once planned)
- [ ] 1. <task>
- [ ] 2. <task>

## Decisions / blockers
- <approach chosen, ADR links, anything that blocked the autonomous run>
```

Update the **Phase** field and append to **Log** at every transition. During build, the **feature
branch's copy is canonical**: the dossier was committed on main at the design gate and rides into the
worktree at branch time, so tick tasks and log in the worktree's `.wi/` and the updates ride the PR;
`main`'s copy catches up on merge. The build phase ticks the task
checkboxes here, so a resumed (or handed-off) run knows exactly what's left. Record the chosen approach and
any blocker here too; it's what the user reads after a hands-off run. `progress.md` is the run's state
of record: phase re-entry reads it (plus the active phase artifact) and never re-Reads prior-phase
artifacts already summarized here (workflow.md's context budget).

## `tokens.md` template

Append a row the **moment** each subagent's completion notification arrives (**the ledger rule**;
phase skills cite it by this name): the token figure exists only in that notification, and a dispatch
that returns without one (e.g. a resumed agent) records `unavailable`, never an estimate. Each row also
carries its **Duration**: the notification's elapsed time, or the delta between your dispatch stamp and
the notification's arrival (OS clock); `unavailable` when neither exists, never an estimate. Name each
row's **Source** with the same short string you pass as the dispatch's `description` (the subagent + its
specific job, e.g. `task-runner: task 3 (@/db seam)`): ship's `token_report.py` labels each
`## Subagent detail` row from the harness's `agent-<id>.meta.json` `description`, so a shared name makes
the split and this ledger joinable by eye. ship
compiles the totals at the dossier tidy and `dev` includes the table in the final report. The scaffold is written by `check_tokens.py --init` from `_ledger.TEMPLATE`
(the source of truth for the exact bytes); the block below is illustrative.

```markdown
---
type: Token Ledger
title: <feature title>
feature: <slug>
timestamp: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# Token ledger: <feature title>

| Phase | Source | Tokens | Duration | Basis |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| research | researcher: <topic> | <n> | 3m12s | exact (completion notification) |
| build W1 | task-runner: task 1 | <n> | 5m48s | exact |
| build W1 | task-runner: task 2 | <n> | unavailable | exact |
| orchestrator | main thread, all phases | (see Orchestrator section) | n/a (see below) | parsed by token_report.py; unavailable if the parse fails - never substitute or estimate |

**Subagents (exact): <sum>.**
**Σ compute: <dur> across <n> dispatches.**
**Autonomous wall-clock (excl. manual steps): <dur>.**

## Orchestrator

_PENDING: the ledger is scaffolded by `check_tokens.py --init` (research:0), rows appended live, and
ship replaces this section during the dossier tidy (BEFORE the dossier commit and the PR) by running
`python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ship/scripts/token_report.py --write <this file>`, which parses the
session transcript (per-turn `usage`: output, fresh input, cache write/read) and recomputes the Subagents
sum. That parsed figure is the **only** reliable orchestrator measure; if the parse fails it writes
`Orchestrator: unavailable for this run`; never a substitute, estimate, or invented figure. At close-out
`check_tokens.py <this file>` gates `Phase = done`: a tokens.md still reading PENDING (or missing rows,
or (on this Duration-column format) missing Duration cells / unfilled duration totals; an honest
`unavailable` always passes) is a defect that blocks the PR._
```

The same `--write` also fills the two duration totals: **Σ compute** is summed from the rows' Duration
cells (total delegated effort; parallel waves overlap, so it can exceed real time) and the **autonomous
wall-clock** is the sum of the two autonomous phase spans from `progress.md`'s Log stamps (research →
gate-open plus gate-approved → PR), which drops the brainstorm dialogue, the handoff, the design-gate
wait, and idle time between resumed sessions; and, on **Claude Code**, appends a
`## Subagent detail` section read from the harness's per-agent sidecar transcripts
(`<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`): each dispatch's exact input/output/cache-write/cache-read split,
model, transcript-stamped duration, and an **estimated** cost, each row labeled from the sidecar
`agent-<id>.meta.json` `description` (fallback: the agent type, then the dispatch prompt's opening) so it
matches the ledger `Source` above (exact tokens × published list prices,
"as of" date shown: the tokens are exact; only the dollar figure is an estimate). Platform note: Codex
and Copilot expose no per-subagent usage or sidecar transcripts; rows there record `unavailable`, and
on Copilot the accountable unit is the session's **AI credits** (see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/copilot-tools.md`).

## `roadmap.md` template (optional, multi-feature efforts)

```markdown
---
type: Roadmap
title: <project / epic name>
description: <one-line epic summary>
timestamp: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# Roadmap: <project / epic name>

| # | Feature | Slug | Status | Depends on |
|---|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | <feature> | <slug> | done | - |
| 2 | <feature> | <slug> | in-progress | 1 |
| 3 | <feature> | <slug> | planned | 1 |

## Notes
- Sequencing rationale, parking-lot ideas, things explicitly out of scope.
