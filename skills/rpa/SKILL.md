  Turn a UiPath PDD into a built RPA solution. Use this skill when the user types "/wi:rpa", points at a
  PDD/SDD/.docx, or says "build a UiPath workflow/automation from this PDD", "automate <process>", "follow
  PDD.docx". It ingests the PDD (via markitdown), runs a deep TO-BE refinement brainstorm (filling the
  gaps real PDDs leave), writes an SDD + architecture + assumptions, confirms them at the design gate,
  then builds a REFramework project via the UiPath skills (XAML-only or coded — your choice at the design
  gate) to an open PR. One run handles a
  multi-process PDD. Add "--auto" for a hands-off run. Reuses the wi spine (gate, worktrees, parallel
  waves, ship, docs-sync, token report).

# /wi:rpa "<pdd path | describe the process>" — PDD → SDD → built REFramework project

`wi:rpa` is the rigorous **front half** of an RPA build: it does the thinking (ingest → TO-BE → SDD) and
hands a high-fidelity spec to UiPath's own skills for the build. wi owns the method, the gate, and the
artifacts; **`uipath-rpa-workflows` owns the build** (XAML or coded) — borrow, don't reinvent.

Defaults (set in the rpa-constitution, overridable): **REFramework**, build paradigm **approved at the design
gate (XAML-only default, or coded)**, build to an **open PR**, gate =
**Workflow Analyzer clean + `uip` validate**, **prefer Integration Service connectors/APIs over UI** where
one exists (UI is a fine answer when it doesn't).

It has the same two interactions as `wi:dev`: the **brainstorm** (here, the deep TO-BE refinement) and the
**design gate** (sign off the SDD + assumptions). `--auto` collapses everything after brainstorm.

## Procedure

1. **Bootstrap the prerequisites.** Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rpa/references/uipath-bootstrap.md`:
   ensure **markitdown**, the **UiPath skills** plugin, and the **.NET 8 runtime** (the `uip` CLI + build need
   it) are installed (offer to install if absent), and on an existing UiPath repo delegate structure discovery
   to UiPath's `uipath-project-discovery-agent`.
2. **Register inputs & components, ingest the PDD.** Follow
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rpa/references/ingest.md`: catalog the supporting files in the repo (API
   refs, CSV/mapping tables, sample data, screenshots) into `.wi/inputs.md`; detect reusable components
   into `.wi/components.md`; convert the PDD to `pdd.md` with markitdown (skip if it's already Markdown).
3. **Brainstorm — refine the TO-BE (the one conversation).** Follow
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rpa/references/brainstorm-protocol.md`: take the PDD's **existing ToBe as
   the baseline**, refine it (gaps, missing/redundant steps, branches, exceptions), clarify each open step
   as UI activity / API / connector **inline** (no bias — UI is valid), decompose the PDD into its **1..N
   processes**, and for each define the transaction and dispatcher/performer shape, and **elicit the Orchestrator
   provisioning** (org/tenant/folder link, UiPath Agent name(s), and the queue / asset / storage-bucket /
   published-process names) into `.wi/orchestrator.md`. **Stamp the brainstorm mode** in `progress.md`
   (`brainstorm via superpowers:brainstorming` | `via wi fallback`). Log every gap you fill as an assumption.
   Parse `--auto` here (Gate mode).
4. **Plan — write the artifacts** (layout: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rpa/references/rpa-directory.md`):
   - **`architecture.md`** — the whole-solution **Runtime diagram** (Dispatcher + every Performer, incl. a
     2nd/3rd, + queues + systems + Orchestrator; see `references/refr-architecture.md`), validated with
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/scan/scripts/check_mermaid.py`.
   - **`sdd.md`** — one Solution Design Document. **Choose the ToC** per the precedence in
     `references/sdd-template.md`: an existing project SDD's ToC wins → `.wi/sdd-template.md` → the bundled
     base ToC. §7.1.x repeats per process; §7.1.3 is each process's flow diagram (kept in its `tobe.md`);
     §1.3/§3.1/§7.2–7.6 are filled from `.wi/orchestrator.md` (the elicited resource names).
   - per process: **`tobe.md`** (refined from the PDD's ToBe + its flow diagram); `assumptions.md` and
     `process-inventory.md` at run level.
   - **`tasks.md`** = the multi-process build DAG: shared components first, then processes, then each
     process's independent sub-workflows — parallel where the DAG allows.
5. **Design gate.** Render the SDD summary + architecture + the assumptions register **and the open
   dependencies `D1..Dn`** inline (use the same gate format as `wi:research`); the user must **resolve or
   knowingly defer each open dep** — no silent "later". Confirm: approve / amend / stop — **and have the user approve the build
   paradigm: XAML-only (pure activities, default) or coded `.cs`** (a HARD binary — **no Invoke-Code middle
   ground**), recorded in `progress.md` (`Build paradigm:`). `--auto` records and proceeds on the constitution default (XAML-only). On
   approval, **harvest the design-phase learnings** into `.wi/learnings/<slug>.md` — non-obvious decisions,
   gap resolutions, and domain rules surfaced in the brainstorm, marked *candidate (pre-build)*. wi:rpa's
   front and back halves often run in **different environments**, so without a gate-time harvest a
   front-half-only run leaves no compounded knowledge; ship later confirms these against the build and
   promotes the general ones to `.wi/rpa-constitution.md` / `.wi/glossary.md`.
6. **Build.** Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rpa/references/build-uipath.md`: create the worktree,
   **reuse components from `.wi/components.md` before building new**, delegate **low-code XAML REFramework**
   generation to `uipath-rpa-workflows` per process/sub-workflow in **parallel waves** (state the paradigm in
   the prompt — the **approved paradigm**: XAML-only → pure drag-drop activities, **no Invoke Code and no `.cs`**;
   coded-allowed → `.cs` workflows ok; scaffold each unit as REFramework per the SDD, never Blank),
   append each unit's tokens to `tokens.md`, and
   register any new reusable component back into `.wi/components.md`.
7. **Verify & ship.** Gate = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rpa/references/verification-gate.md` (**paradigm =
   XAML REFramework** + Workflow Analyzer + `uip` validate + `tokens.md` present). Then reuse the **ship**
   skill (`wi:ship`) for the docs-sync, PR, close-out, **compound/learnings** (confirm + promote the candidate
   `.wi/learnings/<slug>.md` written at the gate), and the **token report (`tokens.md` — mandatory)**.
   **Ship is dev-shaped — map its artifacts to the RPA ones:** gate → the RPA verification gate above;
   `spec.md` (acceptance criteria, review) → **`sdd.md`** (acceptance + §7 process details); `pitfalls.md` →
   the **`assumptions.md`** register; `brief.md` → **`pdd.md`**; `repo-map.md` → n/a. The dev "7-file dossier"
   tidy becomes the **RPA dossier**: `progress.md`, `pdd.md`, `sdd.md`, `architecture.md`, `assumptions.md`,
   `process-inventory.md`, `orchestrator.md`, per-process `tobe.md`, `tasks.md`, `tokens.md`, `PR.md`. One PR
   per run by default (per-process PRs are an option for large solutions).

## What carries over from the wi spine

The design gate, isolated worktrees, **parallel build waves**, the ship PR + **docs-sync** (architecture
diagrams kept current), **compound/learnings**, the **token report**, `check_mermaid.py`, and
plugin-bootstrap all work unchanged — `wi:rpa` swaps the *domain* (UiPath/SDD/PDD) into the same machine.
