# The `.wi/` layout for RPA

`wi:rpa` reuses the `.wi/` model — same [OKF](/docs/specs/2026-06-14-okf-knowledge-format.md) frontmatter
profile — with an extra tier: **project → run (a PDD/solution) → process**. One `/wi:rpa` run is one goal
folder for the whole solution, with **one SDD** covering its 1..N processes.

```

## Conventions

- **Project-level files persist & compound** across runs: `rpa-constitution.md`, `sdd-template.md` (if
  present), `inputs.md`, `components.md`, `orchestrator.md`, `glossary.md`, `learnings.md`, `learnings/`. Never pruned. Build + compound write
  back (especially new reusable components → `components.md`).
- **The SDD structure is overridable** (clients differ): an existing project `sdd.md`'s ToC wins; else
  `.wi/sdd-template.md`; else the bundled base ToC (see `references/sdd-template.md`).
- **`architecture.md` is the whole-solution Runtime diagram** — dispatcher + every performer (2nd/3rd) +
  queues + systems + Orchestrator. Per-process flow diagrams live in each `tobe.md` (and feed SDD §7.1.3).
- **`orchestrator.md` is the resource manifest** — the concrete Orchestrator names (folder, processes,
  queues, assets, buckets, agents, triggers) elicited in brainstorm; SDD §1.3/§3.1/§7.2–7.6 are filled from
  it, and the back-half build provisions from it. Secret/credential **names** only, never values.
- **Faithful `pdd.md`.** Don't edit it to "fix" the process — refinement lives in `tobe.md`.
- ADRs for hard-to-reverse choices (REFramework vs coded, dispatcher split, queue model) go in the
  project-wide `.wi/adr/` log, same as `wi:dev`.

## OKF frontmatter (RPA types)

Same profile as `wi:dev` (see [wi-directory](/skills/research/references/wi-directory.md) and the
[OKF spec](/docs/specs/2026-06-14-okf-knowledge-format.md)); the RPA-specific `type` values are:
`rpa-constitution.md` → `RPA Constitution`, `inputs.md` → `Input Registry`, `components.md` →
`Component Registry`, `orchestrator.md` → `Orchestrator Manifest`; per run: `progress.md` →
`RPA Run Progress`, `pdd.md` → `PDD`, `architecture.md` → `Architecture`, `sdd.md` → `SDD`,
`process-inventory.md` → `Process Inventory`, `assumptions.md` → `Assumption Register`, `tasks.md` →
`Task List`, `verification.md` → `Verification` *(ephemeral — checker output, pruned at close-out)*,
`tokens.md` → `Token Ledger`, `PR.md` → `PR Description`; per process:
`processes/<p>/tobe.md` → `TO-BE`. `orchestrator.md` SHOULD carry a `resource:` pointing at the
Orchestrator folder URL (names only, never secret values).

For a **rename/rebrand** run, the researcher's **Runtime State Inventory** (the five-category sweep) maps
onto the existing RPA registries rather than a new file: Orchestrator **queue/asset/process names** and
**in-flight queue items** → `orchestrator.md` (live config + stored data), credential **names** →
`orchestrator.md` (names only, per the rpa-constitution), the **published package name** → a build
artifact. Each load-bearing row still becomes its own migration task in `tasks.md`.
